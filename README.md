# Investigating-Page-Eviction-Algorithms-
Implementation of simulations for assessing the FIFO, LRU, 2nd-chance clock and optimal memory replacement algorithm by tracking the amount of page faults with theoretical strings of page access pattern

Memory.java simulates a memory object. 

Replacement.java holds the page-replacement algorithms and the main method to run the simulation
